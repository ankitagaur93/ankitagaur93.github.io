I completed my PhD in July 2024 in Energy Engineering at University College Cork, Ireland, within the Energy Policy and Modelling Group. I was supervised by Professor Hannah Daly and Professor John Curtis. The topic of my doctoral thesis is "Depicting energy service demand as a mitigation lever in energy systems model" . This thesis demonstrates the value of including demand-side measures in Energy Systems Optimization Models (ESOMs) and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). It highlights how energy service demands can be managed to reduce GHG emissions, particularly in the residential and transport sectors. Further, by incorporating empirical evidence of the phenomena that drive energy service demands, the research develops methodologies to improve the quantification of decarbonization scenarios in ESOMs and IAMs. During my PhD, I contributed to the development of energy service demands within the TIMES Ireland Model (TIM) which has been used by the Climate Change Advisory Council as a part of their recommendation to the government for Irelandâ€™s legal carbon budget.

My research focuses on developing energy systems optimization models, simulation frameworks, and sustainable pathways for a secure and just energy transition. This research aims to provide insights into decarbonization and climate change mitigation options, as well as inform national-level energy policy. To date, my work has primarily concentrated on both developed countries, such as Ireland, and developing countries in South Asia. While energy demand reduction is being discussed as a mitigation strategy in Global North countries, access to energy services remains unequal and disproportionately low in the Global South. I believe a closer examination of the unique challenges and opportunities in the Global South is necessary, as these countries will significantly influence global efforts to mitigate climate change in the coming century.
