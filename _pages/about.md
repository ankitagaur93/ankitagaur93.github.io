I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Energy, Environmental, and Economic Systems Analysis (CEEESA) in the Energy Systems Division at Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois, USA. I provide country coordination support for Indonesia as part of the Net Zero World Initiative. Additionally, I contribute to the development of a multi-model simulation framework within CEEESA, focused on addressing energy security and resiliency challenges. 

I completed my PhD in July 2024 in Energy Engineering at University College Cork, Ireland, within the [Energy Policy and Modelling Group](https://www.ucc.ie/en/epmg/). I was supervised by [Professor Hannah Daly](https://research.ucc.ie/profiles/D021/h.daly@ucc.ie) and [Professor John Curtis](https://www.esri.ie/people/john-curtis). The topic of my doctoral thesis: "Depicting energy service demand as a mitigation lever in energy systems model". This thesis demonstrates the value of including demand-side measures in Energy Systems Optimization Models (ESOMs) and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). It highlights how energy service demands can be managed to reduce GHG emissions, particularly in the residential and transport sectors. Further, by incorporating empirical evidence of the phenomena that drive energy service demands, the research develops methodologies to improve the quantification of decarbonization scenarios in ESOMs and IAMs.

My research focuses on developing energy systems optimization models, simulation frameworks, and sustainable pathways for the energy transition. This research aims to provide insights into decarbonization and climate change mitigation options, as well as inform national-level energy policy. My research to date has focused on developed countries like Ireland and developing countries of South Asia. While energy demand reduction is being talked about as a mitigation strategy in Global North countries, access to energy services remains unequal and disproportionately low in the Global South. I believe a closer examination of the unique challenges and
opportunities in the Global South are necessary as these countries will significantly influence global efforts to mitigate climate change in the coming century.
