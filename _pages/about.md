I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Energy, Environmental, and Economic Systems Analysis (CEEESA) in the Energy Systems Division at Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois, USA. I provide country coordination support for Indonesia as part of the Net Zero World Initiative. Additionally, I contribute to the development of a multi-model simulation framework within CEEESA, focused on addressing energy security and resiliency challenges, particularly in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Balkans. 

I have experience working with multiple energy systems optimization frameworks, developing simulation models, and developing methods to operationalize available data to gain insights into energy demand patterns. I have also developed sustainable decarbonization pathways to inform climate action policy at the national level and have experience modeling policy measures using energy systems optimization models to inform mitigation strategies. I am particularly interested in energy systems modeling research, exploring global and national energy transition scenarios, and analyzing their impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
