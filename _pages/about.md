I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Energy, Environmental, and Economic Systems Analysis (CEEESA) in the Energy Systems Division at Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois, USA. I provide country coordination support for Indonesia as part of the Net Zero World Initiative. Additionally, I contribute to the development of a multi-model simulation framework within CEEESA, focused on addressing energy security and resiliency challenges. My research focuses on developing energy systems optimization models, simulation and analytical frameworks, and sustainable pathways for energy transition that provide insight into decarbonization and climate change mitigation options, and inform policy at the national level. 

I completed my PhD in July 2024 in Energy Engineering within the [Energy Policy and Modelling Group](https://www.ucc.ie/en/epmg/), University College Cork, Ireland under the supervision of [Professor Hannah Daly](https://research.ucc.ie/profiles/D021/h.daly@ucc.ie) and [Professor John Curtis](https://www.esri.ie/people/john-curtis).
